**Headplate surgery + ref screw protocol**

**Tools**

_Autoclave:_

- Beakers for saline, ethanol, distilled water, betadine
- Envelope with cotton buds, pipette tips, sugi sponges
- 2 sharp forceps
- 1 or 2 large blunt forceps
- Scissors for skin, scissors for connective tissue
- Scalpel blade, cement mixer thing to hold skull whilst scoring.
- Cement brush holder
- Tin foil for sterility
- Ground screw

_Not autoclave:_

- Drape, gown, sterile gloves
- Non sterile forceps for reflex/tongue
- Cement mixing wells (cold), + cement stuff + icebox + brushes
- Headplate, in ethanol
- Vetbond
- Ground screw screwdriver, drilling tips in hot beads.
- Viscotears + non-sterile cotton buds
- Shaver
- Damp paper towel
- Headplate holder, ethanol + tin foil
- 1ml syringes for general use
- Scalpel blade
- Drill bits (hot beads)
- Screwdriver for ground screw (hot beads)

**Prep Tools**

- Run through
- Autoclave instruments: drain water, check clean water. 121 C, no packaging, start.
- Prepare Rimadyl, 0.1ml in 9.9ml saline, put in needle, mark where you need to push needle to.

**Prep Cage**

- Prepare animal cage
    - Empty cage and cage cover
    - Cage bedding
    - Paper house and paper tunnel
    - Spinning wheel
    - Water bottle + water
    - Food
- Prepare animal label
    - Pyrat -> under animal tab
    - add procedure (e.g. implantation of head brackets) to the animal
    - Move animal to a new cage
    - Change the experimenter if the animal is not under your name
    - Under cage tab, print cage label

**Cooler box with mixing tray**

- If you are doing surgery alone, maybe you want to bring the cooler box with the mixer tray before the surgery

**Surgery**

1. Turn iso + scavenger on in both rooms
    
2. Weigh animal, record on surgical sheet and bring the animal
    
3. **Induce anaesthesia, Rimadyl, viscotears, shave**
    
    - iso @ 3 -> mouse/chamber connections
    - place mouse in chamber and monitor for ~ 3mins until breathing @ 1hz
    - switch iso to shaving station, change down to 2, place mouse snout in cone, pedal reflex check
    - subcat inject Rimadyl (1%, 0.1ml in 9.9ml saline), flat, use palm to push
    - apply viscotears to eyes
    - shave head from just behind ears to inbetween eyes, consider how much space you need.
4. **Transfer + earbars** turn iso on in main room @ 2.
    
    - scruff and cup to bring to main surgical set up
    - non sterile forceps to open mouth and move tongue out of the way. Move bottom jaw under bite bar and slide top jaw over the top until teeth can lock in. Move anaesthesia cone over snout.
    - adjust height/centre of animal to be appropriate for ear bars.
    - put large ear bars in place ready to position properly
    - using earbar adaptors, make sure loose but easy to tighten. Keep parallel and place in one ear nodule, holding there, place the other side in the ear nodule. Once happy, fix with main ear bars gently/carefully, and tighten.
5. Betadine + ethanol, 3x + from centre outwards to clean scalp.
    
    - Apply betadine directly onto the cotton bud and then onto the scalp (avoid wasting betadine).
    - Wash with distilled water/saline.
    - Possibly dry with a cotton bud.
6. Scrub up. Open gown and gloves. Remove old gown, wash hands and arms, put new gown on. Half put one sterile glove on, then use to fully pull the other over the gown. Then fully pull the first glove over the gown.
    
    - Put sterile foil around the tools and equipment for sterility
7. **Clear skin and connective tissue.**
    
    - Using tweezers and small scissors under microscope, cut away the skin to leave connective tissue and skull underneath. Apply saline to the skull to keep moist. Can help push skin out of the way with q tips.
    - Then, using connective tissue scissors and tweezers, start cutting away the connective tissue. Try and work in a circle around the edges, keeping skull moist if it looks like its drying out.
    - After cutting most of the connective tissues near the edges, use skull scaper to scape the connective tissue off. Try to clear the tissues near the skull fissures (may be best when the skull starts to dry)
    - Once happy, apply a bit of vetbond to a pipette tip. Then apply to where the skin meets the skull to keep it fixed in place, the vetbond should leave the tip by capillary action. Apply more to pipette if necessary. Can pull up skin to form barrier to cement.
8. **Hydrogen peroxide + activator.** Apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to a qtip and lightly dab the skull. Quickly wash off with saline, then dry with a dry q tip. Repeat this action with **the green activator** from the cement mixing set.
    
    - Usually we do not need hydrogen peroxide anymore. We can just use green activator.
9. Score skull gently with scalpel, for better cementing, using cement pallet to limit skull movements.
    
10. Measure co-ordinates: - make sure bregma and lambda are equal depth. - Set bregma to 0,0,0. - Mark craniotomy site: (normal co-ord is AP -3.8/lamba + 0.5) - mark site of gnd screw on LHS (opposite).
    
11. Ground screw: Take the screwdriver and drills out of the autoclave and put them in alcohol and then in saline. Burr hole for ground screw and screw it in secure)
    
12. Using headplate holder, take headplate out of ethanol and position in place where you want it (i.e. if using headplate with well, the posterior part lying just on lambda, hole covering L/R V1.). Head plate should be flat but slightly tiled towards the L/R side. Once happy, move the headplate up.
    
13. ****When the skull is dry(!), mix some cement in the mixing wells and apply an initial layer around the edge of the skull. Move the headplate down into place. With wet cement, apply to the inside of the hole of the headplate around the edge, letting it suck down into the gaps. Then starting building up at the front and back. Keep building up, filling any gaps until happy that the headplate is secure. Form a bridge over the headplate.
    
14. Turn iso down, when cement is dry/hard, remove ear bars, then after remove headplate holder. Let the mouse breathing rate start to increase then move to recovery box by cupping.
    
15. Monitor recovery, wet mash, condensed milk, metacam
    

**Highlight**

- Monitor the breathing constantly
    - 1 Hz breathing
    - If too fast, try toe pinching to see if the anaesthesia is getting lighter
- Lower the iso gradually over the course of the surgery (usually increment of 0.25)
