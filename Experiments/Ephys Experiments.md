Two sets of Ephys Experiments:

	1. Acute Recordings with Neuropixels 1.0 (2023)

	 2. Chronic Recordings with Neuropixels 2.0 (2024-2025, under development)


## Acute Recordings

*Aim: Record in MEC and V1 Simultaneously on Trained Mice*
##### 1. The animal is implanted with a headplate + ground screw (see [[Headplate Surgery]])
The mice were first anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and hair was shaved off on top of the skull. Viscotears were applied to both eyes to keep the eyes moist. The mice were transferred to a heating pad and head fixed by ear bars. 0.4mm diameter marks were made on the skull ML 3.4mm from Bregma and on top of the transverse suture for mEC probe. A dot was marked AP –3.1mm and ML 2.5mm from Bregma and 4 dots were marked +_ 0.5mm from the centre for V1 probe. A ground screw was affixed 1.0-1.5mm posterior and 0.5mm on the left to the Lambda. A headplate was attached to the skull on top of the Bregma with transparent metabond.
##### 2. Habituation Before Training
he mouse is first head-fixed on the wheel in the rig and habituated to a random-dot closed-loop VR corridor using a Bonsai script (Lopes et al.,2015) for 10-30 minutes in 3-5 days to encourage running . The lickport is slowly brought closer to the mouse once the mouse is accustomed to the environment.

##### 3. Behavioural Training
Once the mouse is used to the rig, the mouse is introduced to the spatial navigation corridor (familiar) (_Fig4._B) and the water restriction protocol starts with at least 40ml/kg hydrogel given. The closed-loop VR corridor with white noise background is rendered by BonVision and displayed on the three screens. The 140cm corridor has a black cross in white background contexual landmark at 30cm and two pairs of repeating landmarks (first vertical grating and second plaid), A-B-A-B at 50, 70, 90, 110cm (_Fig4._B). The reward zone is initially 110-130cm. Once a trial finishes, a gray screen is shown for 3-5s. In the early stage, the tubing in the lickport is pulled out from the port so it’s close to the mouth of the mouse. This allows the mouse to be familiar with licking reward which is made of 10% sucrose and cherry flavor cool-aid but the lick detection sensors are blocked by the tubing. The mouse is first encouraged to run in the corridor and passive reward (~2μL) is given to the mouse at the centre of the reward zone. The tubing is pulled closer to the sensor and reward is given to the mouse to test if the mouse could lick at this distance before the session starts every day. Once the mouse can respond and lick the reward within range of the lick detection working distance, the task is set to hybrid which gives passive reward at the centre of the reward zone and active reward is given if the mouse licked within 10cm before the centre of the reward zone. The active reward is 2-3 times more than passive reward. If the mouse licked over 15 times before the reward zone, the trial is omitted and restarted. Reward zone size and overlicking threshold are gradually reduced to 10cm and 10 times. In addition, licking at third landmark rather than 5th and active reward rate are also used as indicators of training progress. The mouse is transferred to the electrophysiology rig and trained for 5-7 days before electrophysiology recording (_Fig.4A_).
