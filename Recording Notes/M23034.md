|Lower the 2nd probe|1550|Something blocking and bending the probe. So had to move a bit lateral AP 3.0-3.2 roughly, ML 2.7-2.9 roughly. D: 15000-186500|

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||30 laps familiar and 30 laps of novel. 10 each alternating after.He just keeps grooming and trying pushing the lickport away…. Pushed the lickport away at lap 10. He just wouldn’t run if the lickport is there… He was running a bit and grooming the whisker a bit sometimes…. Did he get wet on the whiskers or something? One possibility is that he was not licking and the rewards made the whiskers wet. Moved the lickport back, and he wasn’t licking at all…. Keeps running a bit in the novel laps. Not much reaction? Also not licking at all. Grabbed onto the lickport at lap 9 of novel track. Grooming again at lap 14… Took the lickport out. Probably he wouldn’t lick at all today so no point of having the lickport since it’s making him grooming the whisker somehow.|

|G1 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Start workflow and recording|1742|Been on the rig for a long time and forgot to lick. Carefully pulled the tubing up without making any movements on lickport. Started again. Finally licked at lap 10. Got an active at lap 5 of novel. Not sure if it’s learned or he’s just trying. But mostly, he’s just doing passive. Got an active at 16th, 19th lap of novel. Performance progressively gets better. Active at 25th lap of novel. Accidentally got active at 27th lap of active because he was trying to groom…. Got some tears on the left eye and he wanted to groom to clear it off. Around lap 32 of familiar - cleared it off with a cotton bud. Performance improved afterwards.|

|Head fixation and lickport adjustment|1553||
|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy|1555|Look good but added some ACSF on top for 5min so the dura gel is more easily penetrated.|

|Set up spikeglx for recording|1610||
|Put the mirror on||MEC: D5400 to 7201  <br>v1: 7800 to 11650|
|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe||roughly ML 3.2-3.3. 150-200 micron anterior to the sinus. The probe surprisingly bent at near 2000 micron depth. Probably because of more medial. I wasn’t aware of that due to looking at the right camera and only the top is bending so missed it. I kept going in for 800 microns and noticed the signal wasn’t changing at all so realised definitely something went wrong so found out about it by looking at cameras and from the actual probe. Retracted 1000 microns immediately|
|Check LFP and spiking|||
|Lower the 2nd probe||V1 probe was very difficult. The craniotomy looked fine but somehow I couldn’t penetrate at all. Tried 5 locations. The probe was bending quite a lot. Also had a misleading bending from the left camera. Spotted on the right camera. Do decided to add a bit ACSF and new dura gel. Re-attempted but still couldn’t penetrate from ideal locations. So went a bit more lateral and anterior than desired. Roughly AP 2.9 and ML 2.9-3.0.|
|Wait for signal to stabilize|1707-1717||

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|G0 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Wait for specified time|1717|4 min of gray screen. 10 laps of each track. Licking behaviour is very good today. First active at lap 8 of familiar. Stopping at the landmarks in the first block of novel track. First novel active at lap 9.|
|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||Good behaviour. But overall, the speed is quite slow. Only did 80 laps in total in 1hr15min. He had a long rest period. Might have some nice resting data to look at and some gray screen corridor data to look at. Also saw sharp synch between layers (V1 and HPC?) in AP signal.|

|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe||roughly ML 3.2-3.3, 200-250micron anterior to the sinus. Can only go through 2000 microns - 200 channels.|
|Check LFP and spiking||V 1 very lateral - ML 2.9-3.1, AP 3.1-3.2. It couldn’t penetrate even after applying ACSF and dura gel. I probably made misjudgement on the dura gel and the dural gel was brought up by kwikcast already. After realising, it’s probably too late as the same happened two days - 30min each that dries out the dura. So only the lateral edge of the craniotomy had some dura gel conserved to go through. The visual signal is also worse. This seems last day of recording.|
|Lower the 2nd probe|||

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||10 laps of novel and familiar alternating. He was waken up by the reward delivery before I start. Doesn’t move much after two laps. Not willing to run for the first 12 laps and only walking after… All active but very few laps - stationary for most of the time. Only 50 laps in total and some of them are just stationary.|
