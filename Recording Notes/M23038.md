|Lower the first probe||MEC probe ML 3.3-3.5. 300-400 ish micron anterior to sinus. Might be in slightly different layers than usual or a bit of subiculum. 3600-3700 depth. Got a big dura gel bubble so need to clean after this recording.|
|Check LFP and spiking|||
|Lower the 2nd probe||Went in quite anterior for V1 and avoided the blood vessel. AP 2.8-3.0 ish, ML 2.4-2.6. Signal of V1 is not that robust but getting quite some v1 signal. 3200-3300 depth.|
|Wait for signal to stabilize|1518-1528|Fairly quick today - took an hour only to settle everything|

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||Her behaviour is always quite stationary and anxious - so wouldn’t expect much running tbh. Stopped at first landmark already… But got active in first lap after 20s. Had some aborted trials for doing nothing for more than a minute - might be interesting to see some state-changing stuff? Saw some sequenced signal from dorsal to ventral MEC while the animal’s not running. In first lap of the novel, she did some hesitant back and forth movements (she got surprised and scared?) when passing the new landmarks and stopped at 4th landmark and the trial was aborted… In 4th lap, she licked after 2nd plaid - so probably need some time to notice the reward zone difference. In 5th novel lap, she even stopped after 2nd plaid and got irritated that there was no reward and grabbed onto the lickport. Made her walk a bit more to the reward zone and also gave some manual reward at the end to encourage her. 9th novel, she stopped at 6th landmark and stared at it for a long time without reaching the reward zone yet. Gave her manual reward at the end of timer to encourage her and got an active because of manual reward. Doing lots of continuous laps after 22nd novel. Stopped in front of the 1st landmark at 31st familiar - surprised? Had a few sudden stops and continued running in this lap. Did more than 100 laps in total. Overall better performance than expected.|

|Head fixation and lickport adjustment|1435||
|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy||The dura gel in V1 might be brought up a bit by kwikcast but remained on top of V1. Tried to remove it but it went back down so decided to add ACSF and take care of it after recording just in case of any bleeding when pulling out the dura gel…|

|Place the probe(s) onto the manipulator and connect ground and headstage cable|1445||
|Set up spikeglx for recording|||
|Put the mirror on|||
|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe||Couldn’t go through somehow… Adding ACSF for 5 min and see if it’s doable. Went slightly more medial - ML 3.2-3.4, 200-300 micron anterior to sinus, ~3400-3600 depth. The dura gel is too thick and the depth of going in is kinda misleading… But figured out after a few attempts. Seems like the lateral side old dura gel wasn’t removed completely and covered by new dura gel. Therefore, very likely that the air gaps between dura gel and dura causing the dura to become drier. So medial part is much easier to penetrate.. Bit worried about condition tomorrow.|
|Check LFP and spiking|||
|Lower the 2nd probe||V1 left camera is quite misleading… Need to judge from both cameras where the probe is, and this method can be very accurate if operator is very familiar with the condition and outlook of the craniotomy (location of blood vessels and the relative positions of the craniotomy coordinates). The probe went in slightly more medial today to avoid touching the blood vessels - ML 2.4-2.5, AP 3.0-3.1, ~3500 depth. Worrying that hippocampal signal is very weak (could be too medial and posterior, and need to be more anterior for this medial position)|

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||10 laps of familiar and 10 laps of novel. Pretty good at start. Walking than running though. No active seen in first block of familiar and didn’t see much active licking… In the first block of novel, also no active licking and got some stopping at landmarks (learning?) First active at 15th familiar. But she started stopping between laps for a long time. Active laps are rare today. Did see some slowing down behaviour before reward zone. More running today and getting 180 laps.|

But the dura gel is too thick and pulling out with a forceps is very difficult that the dura gel got pulled back by the rest of dura gel. So decided not to do this as seeing some bleeding on the lateral side because of this…|
