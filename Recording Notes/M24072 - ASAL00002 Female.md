Still squeak a bit. Ran at the beginning and stops a bit. Sniff a lot - could be wondering what the lick-port is. 
Trying sleep box - very active but some grooming and rearing up and down, leaning towards the walls

Moving dot. Running at start and groom sometimes. Tried to bring the tubing to her and she can't lick but sipping if brought to her mouth. Started licking at short distance after a few attempts of moving the tubing back and forth. But need to make her run while doing it.
