|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate||Put the two probes and connect them first. Rotate them to opposite orientation to prevent colliding. First attempted MEC.|
|Lower the first probe|14:50|roughly ML 3.4 ish. Posterior and lateral side of the craniotomy of MEC. Took 10min to explore the depth and angles of the camera. Successfully inserted the probe at D: -2870 to 800. First 1000 seems like postrhinal. After 1000, lots of synchronised signals and thought it was noise at the start. But turns out only after 1000. less synchronised signal after roughly 3000 but still some signal so kept going and the probe didn’t bend.|
|Check LFP and spiking|||
|Lower the 2nd probe|1520|this is very difficult as the two rod might hit each other. So adjusted the rotation of the rod twice after moving the second probe close to V1. Every time, move the probe all the way to lateral side so they wouldn’t hit. Decided to inset slightly lateral so they wouldn’t hit, AP 3.1, ML 2.7 ish. Lower the probe slowly and carefully monitor both probes if case of touching and bending. Went from D: 800 to 4300. But Ed noticed some signal change and I decided to retract 300 more just to be safe. After a round of checking everything, seems ok. Pretty good V1 deep layer and hippocampal signal|

|G1 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Start workflow and recording|1613|She started developing white foams on the eye quite a lot. This might be due to long time of lowering the probe and also adjustment of the probe rotation multiple times scares her as the light and shadow were blinking. So only got very few active trials - close to non. Sometimes not even licking after passive reward… So very bad behaviour today. She stopped a while in front of 6th landmark in the first and second laps of novel track. But kept running afterwards. 64th lap (1632), wiped off the white foam as it was stacking up on the eyes. Doesn’t lick much since the second block of familiar… Really good visual responses when running through the landmarks. Strong synchronised signal like theta in MEC? But she just runs all the time. Not much stopping and licking since then…|

|Start workflow and recording|1537|started stimulus after enable recording for 10s. first active at 5th lap and 4 active in first block of familiar. Running but slowing down a little bit at the 6th landmark. No licking at all at the first few laps of novel. Stopped at 6th landmark for a bit in 3rd lap.Kept licking at the last two novel laps but failed to get the reward zone. Got active first lap familiar in second block. Run much faster and perform better in second block of familiar. Entered unstoppable mode somehow since 37th lap (2nd block of familiar) and continue this in second block of novel. Also saw big licking response(? or initiation) in thalamus every time she licks. In third block of novel, tried to give manual reward at the reward zone to remind her but she’s not doing any active. Only one active in third block of famliar. Shes not even licking in the 6th block of novel… The reward drips. Stopped the workflow at 140laps (2830 in the recording). 2min of gray screen and start again. Test if the behaviour changes after gray screen. But seems the same. Running non-stop..|

|Bring animal to the dome room|1413||
|Head fixation and lickport adjustment|1417||
|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy|1420|Both MEC and V1 look good. So decided to move on but add a bit of ACSF on MEC to soften the dura gel so penetration would be easier.|
|Connect ground to the ground screw|||
|Place the probe(s) onto the manipulator and connect ground and headstage cable||The right manipulator(2nd) has half the z range. Couldn’t reach the dura gel so had to lower it…|
|Set up spikeglx for recording|||
|Put the mirror on||MEC: D-9600 to -6150.  <br>v1: D10200 at first channels to 13200|
|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|1430||
|Lower the first probe|1455|roughly ML 3.4. Very posterior. First attempt had bending so added some ACSF and also move more lateral. Successful afterwards.|
|Check LFP and spiking||V 1 very central of the craniotomy and similiar as day 2. roughly AP 3.0 ML 2.6|
|Lower the 2nd probe|30min ish to lower the two probes?|The way I inserted was position both probes at where desired first. Then lower MEC for 1000 and then switch to V1 for 1000. Repeat 3 times and always check if the banks are hitting each other as they are very close to each other. Got big noise across channels on MEC probe and tried to pull out 50 but still there.|
|Wait for signal to stabilize|1538-1547|Seems like slightly more anterior for MEC probe. Not much of running modulated signals across channels. But still pretty good signal overall. Might be in different layers than previous days. Good to have different layers.|

|G0 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Wait for specified time|1548|started stimulus after enable recording for 30s. 10 familiar + 10 novel alternating. Wiped off all the white foam and keep the curtain open so closely monitor all the time. Doing some active. No active in first block of novel. Stopped active in the second block of familiar. Noticed some white foam and removed them immediately. She got active going right after the removal. She seems licking to the second plaid in second block of novel at the start. Try to tell her there’s difference in the reward zone by giving manual reward (bigger reward overall). She managed to do active in 34th or 35th? (check the data later), and had some stopping at landmarks behaviour afterwards. And then she managed to do active a few times. See if the remapping starts here? Would be interesting to explore the data here later. Seems not much active in the third blocks of familiar and novel. But stopping behaviour might be good enough to tell the difference. Overall, much better behaviour than previous two days. But basically not doing active in the second half. She can manage to do active when she wants to….|

|Connect ground to the ground screw|||
|Place the probe(s) onto the manipulator and connect ground and headstage cable||The right manipulator(2nd) has half the z range again somehow… Tested before ephys it could move 15000 but only 6000 when putting the probe on. So readjusted everything and left some D range to move up.|

|Lower the first probe||roughly ML 3.3. Posterior but close to some blood. Got lots of noise. Edd tried to denoise both probes for a while. But still got some. Still, the signals look good.|
|Check LFP and spiking||V 1 more anterior and more medial than before. But similiar patterns on the channels. CA1 looks slightly different. Got a huge chunk of thalamus..|
|Lower the 2nd probe|30min ish to lower the two probes?|MEC down 1000 first and then the second probe for 1000. MEC all the way down. Hallucinating its bending a bit when it’s deep… But all good.|

|G1 familiar + novel|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Start workflow and recording|1640||
|Stop workflow and recording||10 laps of familiar and novel each. Alternating. Not doing active at the start. Also the valve open time 40 isnt working so adjusted to 50 for passive (150 still for active). Got some white foam again after 15 laps. Active rate is quite low overall. Run less than yesterday. Seems watching a lot of landmarks. Did an active of novel track at 29th novel track (learned?) One interesting observation found in lap 38th for familiar: she stopped a while and the grid cell (?) still have some patterns but not like rhythmic and recover the rhythmic pattern 0.5s before she started moving? (have a close look when analysis).Gradually, she’s getting better behaviour since 60 laps. Also walks more slowly. Probably pay more attention and engage to get the task right. Even though the active rate isn’t so high. Think she learned the novel track. In 42-48th laps of novel, she did 6 consecutive active trials. Only 120 laps today, but better performance.|

|Lower the first probe||roughly ML 3.2-3.3. More anterior than usual but seems in the MEC range (if a bit more anterior prob SUB).|
|Check LFP and spiking||V 1 more posterior to avoid the blood in the middle. AP 3.2-3.3 ish ML 2.5-2.6. The visual signal is really bad and only prob 15-20 units? See some nice HPC but quite narrow. Overall this probe is not that great as usual.|

She self corrected it after some laps. Found some grooming behaviour and it was quite strange. Turns out she got a whisker stuck on top of her left eye in the gap between headplate and headplate holder. Helped her remove it…. Overall pretty good behaviour.|
