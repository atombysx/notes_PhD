|G0 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Wait for specified time|||
|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||10 laps of familiar and 10 laps of novel. Behaviour is pretty good at the start. first active at 4th familiar lap. Early lick at first plaid in 7th familiar. Overlicking today. Ran a bit too fast for the first 4 laps of novel. Slowed down at 2nd plaid in 5th lap but a tiny bit. Did active at 6th lap. Then consecutive 3 active! But somehow she doesn’t do any active after in 20 laps. Ran quite fast in familiar second block. No active at all after this… NOt much licking even after 55laps in total. First active for a while in 36th familiar lap.But all passive after and not licking much. Do seem some stopping behaviour -hopefully getting some spatial modulation even though no active trials. The reward was over-flowing. Unstoppable running after 148 laps - unlikely spatial modulation.|
