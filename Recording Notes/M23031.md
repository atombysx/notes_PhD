|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)|1717|This is day one first time exposure to novel track after 30 laps of familiar. A few trials of passive. Got some white thing around the eye. So the performance might not be so good. Doesn’t do any active… After introducing the novel track. She sometimes ran very fast and then sometimes pause a bit and keeps running.|

|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe|1600|Going into AP 2.9-3.0 ML 2.4 ish to avoid blood.|
|Check LFP and spiking||The signal on V1 isnt very good. Got 3 layers of HPC likely. dorsal CA1, CA3(CA2+), or ventral CA1? Also likely some LGN signal, very active.|
|Lower the 2nd probe|||
|Wait for signal to stabilize|1620|D:-1644 to 1800, Went in very smoothly. Also got some sudden noise after 1500 through. More noise than yesterday.|

|G1 two tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Start workflow and recording|1635||
|Stop workflow and recording|1635|Got some nice active trials. However, the mouse can immediately get some active trials for novel track. Does she remember the rule as lick when seeing the second plaid rather than thinking of the corridor as whole? Need to discuss about the stimulus design. Otherwise, nicer behaviour than yesterday.|
||1714|145 laps but at the end she’s not licking, just running|

|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy|1429|MEC is still the same. V1 has some yellow bit on the medial side and pale white bit on the lateral side. Applied some acsf to see better. Removed everything and applied dura gel again just for safety. The blood on the posterior side seems gone so decided to go anterior and medial.|

|G0 tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|
|Wait for specified time|1536||
|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)|1537|Added 6th landmark at 130cm with reward zone at 135cm (110 in familiar). When seeing the novel track in the first 10 laps, she seems now exploring a bit by stopping and watch the landmarks (no active). She stops and watch the first landmark when she’s re-introduced back to familiar track (21st lap) and immediately got active licks after she runs and the following familiar tracks are mostly active. Second block of novel: she stops and watch the landmarks especially plaid in the middle and circles at the end. Magically, she managed to do active after the first passive reward in this block! Back to 3rd block of novel, she’s still exploring a bit, and the performance is quite bad - overlicking and caused abortion of lap in 3rd and 4th laps. Stop quite a lot in front of 6th block. No active in the 3rd block. 4th block, still stopping at both circle(1st and 6th contextual landmark). 5th block of familiar, mostly active. 5th block of novel, no active. Not licking anymore even when there’s some. Lick after a while that it accumulates. After that she just runs non-stop (somehow got an active in novel track for once at the end…)|
