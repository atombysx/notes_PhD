|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||30 laps familiar and 30 laps of novel. 10 each alternating after. Doing passive. Stopping at landmarks still - not fully running though… 7th familiar first active. Missed active at very close positions and couldn’t do much active any more… Doing some active and had one lap with manual reward at the reward zone to stimulate the active behaviour. Mostly passive. Had some laps that she didn’t move at all - slightly better than before. In the first novel lap, the eyes are much more dilated and stop at landmarks back and forth a bit. In the 2nd lap, she stopped at 2nd landmark for 5s and then ran through. In the third lap, had a 0.5s pause at 6th landmark. Ran really fast in 6th novel lap. Stopping behaviour in 7th novel lap. Lots of laps watching the landmarks and all finished with passive reward. Had some licking to first plaid in 32nd familiar lap. She had some licking to first landmark in second block of novel (31, 35). Overall 100 laps in 1hr10min.|

Early lick at first plaid in 7th familiar. Overlicking today. Ran a bit too fast for the first 4 laps of novel. Slowed down at 2nd plaid in 5th lap but a tiny bit. Did active at 6th lap. Then consecutive 3 active! But somehow she doesn’t do any active after in 20 laps. Ran quite fast in familiar second block. No active at all after this… NOt much licking even after 55laps in total. First active for a while in 36th familiar lap.But all passive after and not licking much. Do seem some stopping behaviour -hopefully getting some spatial modulation even though no active trials. The reward was over-flowing. Unstoppable running after 148 laps - unlikely spatial modulation.|

|Bring animal to the dome room|1515||
|Head fixation and lickport adjustment|1517||
|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy|1520|Look good but added some ACSF on top so the dura gel is more easily penetrated.|
|Connect ground to the ground screw|||
|Place the probe(s) onto the manipulator and connect ground and headstage cable|1525|First time inserted the probe too medial and realised it by seeing no theta - probably some higher visual areas. So decided to pull the probe out even though 1500microns in.|
|Set up spikeglx for recording|||
|Put the mirror on|||
|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe||ML 3.1-3.3. 150-250 micron anterior to sinus. Attempted a few times after retraction. Dura gel is quite thick on the lateral side and the area near sinus somehow bends the probe. Decided to go a bit anterior and went in with fast insertion at the start - 500 micron fast insertion. The theta modulation was seen after 1400 microns in and it’s quite assuring. Also had the NIPX suddenly rebooted and acquisition stopped. Restarted the computer and it was fine after. Probably shook the rack of the manipulator panel which is quite close. So be careful when inserting the probe. Depth ~3500.|
|Check LFP and spiking|||
|Lower the 2nd probe||V1 probe was ok just need to avoid the blood. Roughly AP 2.9, ML 2.8. Went through pretty well. Signal in V1 and HPC is really nice. Depth ~3600. See V1 deep layer is wrapped by two axonal signal? (channel 336 - superficial (L2?) and channel 280 - one deep (L6?))|
|Wait for signal to stabilize|1624-1634|The mouse ran a lot during insertion.|

|G0 familiar + novel tracks|**Time**|**Future Notes**|

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||Run pretty a lot at start. First active at 5th familiar lap. Stopped a min after that. Second active at 9th familiar. Interestingly, she licked prior to the reward zone in the first 3 novel laps - is she licking to 2nd plaid? Got active in 4th novel lap -is this when remapping happens? Also active in 5th novel lap. Back to passive after and not moving for 1min at 7th novel lap (aborted). Got active in 12th lap of familiar. Noticed white foam again on right eye.. Wiped it off with cotton bud but not fully. Hope it helps… She’s not performing continuously. Rather, she had lots of stopping but performance looks pretty good. Just the lap number wouldn’t be high. Stopping and staring at first and second landmarks in 11th novel lap ( first one in second block). See some sharp responses to landmarks while she stopped and looked at them. Noticed the pupil was going from forward to up - hopefully capture this from eye tracking and track position in data analysis? But this lap was aborted as she was looking for too long. Got passive in the next lap. Only passive in this block.|

|Head fixation and lickport adjustment|1527||
|Remove kwikcast and check craniotomy|1528|Pulled off kwikcast and saw some dura gel on it and turns out the dura gel on the medial side of V1 was pulled off by kwikcast. This caused a lot bleeding on medial side of V1…. Applied spongostan to stop. Re-applied dura gel after just to be safe.|
|Connect ground to the ground screw|||
|Place the probe(s) onto the manipulator and connect ground and headstage cable|1550||
|Set up spikeglx for recording|||
|Put the mirror on||MEC 3600 Depth, V1 3200-3600 not sure though need to look at visual response.|
|Position both probes above craniotomy sites and reset the D coordinate|||
|Lower the first probe||MEC attempted 5 times but all bent. The last time it bent but it kept still (bent, not bending more) after 500 microns. So I went down 400 microns more at a fast speed. It went through but in the brain 400 microns already - based on the channels. Probably the dura (thicker in the back) and dura gel got toughened over time. Roughly ML 3.3.|
|Check LFP and spiking||V 1 avoid the centre of the bleeding. AP 3.1-3.3, ML 2.5-2.7. Visual signal is slightly worse than before. But went in fine all the way. Just not sure the depth as I applied quite a lot of dura gel today.|

|Start stimulus (shift+B, shift+Q check quad on screen, shift+S)||10 laps of novel and familiar alternating. Run a lap and then stop for quite a while… First active at 4th familiar lap. A lot more stopping today. Not moving at all after 6th novel lap. Decided to let her run 20 laps free from lickport - 11th familiar - 30th familiar and 11th novel - 30th novel. She walks all the way mostly rather than running. Noticed something interesting: the reward wasn’t coming out after I moved the lickport back in at 31st familiar lap and the mouse was licking to nothing even though it’s a passive trial. Then she started stationary again… Doing one and then stop. Don’t know why.. Started running from 31st novel laps. Not running at all after 41st familiar. Moved lickport away at 43rd novel. Started running again. Put it back in at 51st novel. Still not so happy to run..|
